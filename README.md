# Hello-World
My first repository on Github. Learning about Blockchain and Hyperledger atm.
I am pretty new to this and feeling lost and very nervous, however, I am determined to learn and make sure that my skill level will enable me to be productive and contribute to the community.

Best of luck to me ; - ))
